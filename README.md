## Process: Professional Pairing Practice

### Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - Most of the day, start lab after lunch
  - What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - Slack for communication
  - Remo for collaboration
- How often will you take breaks?
  - As needed - communicate if you need to take a break
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Communicate, assess what needs to be done and come up with a plan to get caught up
  - Work outside of lab hours

### Cooperative

  - Make a list of each person's strengths.
  - Kellen - backend, logical, communication
  - Spencer - React, communication
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  - Staying on same page in terms of communication
  - Working together to troubleshoot, find solutions
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Styling, backend, frontend, database setup and queries
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  - Review code together as we build features, communicate while working, and make sure both group members understand the code before moving on to a new feature
  - Speak up if you don’t understand something

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - Let the other person know - be assertive, be receptive to feedback
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - Let the other person know - be assertive, be receptive to feedback
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Be aware of where each person is at, and see it as an opportunity for teaching / growth if one person knows more than the other in a certain area
